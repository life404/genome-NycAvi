# A chromosome-level genome assembly of a avivorous bat (Nyctalus aviator

Currently, there are three carnivorous bat species, namely *Ia io*, *Nyctalus lasiopterus*, and *Nyctalus aviator*, are known to actively prey on seasonal migratory birds (hereinafter referred to as “avivorous bats”). However, the absence of reference genomes impedes a thorough comprehension of the molecular adaptations of avivorous bat species. Herein, we present the high-quality chromosome-scale reference genome of *N. aviator* based on PacBio subread, DNBSeq short-read and Hi-C sequenceing data. The genome assembly size of *N. aviator* is 1.77 Gb, with a scaffold N50 of 102 Mb, of which 99.8% assembly was  anchored into 20 pseudo-chromosomes. After masking 514.3 Mb repetitive sequences, a total of 19,703 protein-coding genes were identified, of which 96.2% were functionally annotated. The genome assembly and gene prediction reached 95.6% and 96.5% completeness of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO), respectively. This chromosome-level reference genome of *N. aviator* fills a gap in the existing information on the genomes of carnivorous bats, especially avivorous ones, and will be valuable for mechanism of adaptations to dietary niche expansion in bat species.
